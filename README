		  Threaded Hamming Number Sequence Generator

			  Copyright 2009 James Ravn

Introduction
------------

This is an exercise in building a multithreaded machine for generating hamming
numbers. The hamming number sequence can be generated efficiently using
threads, following Djisktra's algorithm.

Running
-------

	ant compile
	cd build/classes
	java com.jsravn.hamming.Main

This will generate the first 60 numbers in the sequence. Feel free to modify
Main.java to change this.
